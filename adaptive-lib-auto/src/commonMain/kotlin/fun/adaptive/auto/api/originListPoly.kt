/**
 * Registers a polymorphic Auto list with [worker].
 *
 * After registration peers can use [autoListPoly] to connect to the registered
 * list. To get the connection info needed for [autoListPoly] use the `connectInfo`
 * function of the returned frontend.
 *
 * - Adding/removing items from the list generate a new list instance (on all peers).
 * - Property changes (on any peer) generate a new list instance (on all peers).
 * - Property changes keep the non-affected instances.
 *
 * Each new instance is validated by default, so fragments that use values
 * produced by [originListPoly] can safely use the validation result as it is
 * up-to-date all the time.
 *
 * The list is **NOT** thread safe.
 *
 * @param    onListCommit       Called after the structure of the list has been changed (add/remove), but before the
 *                              state of the fragment is updated.
 * @param    onItemCommit       Called when a property of a list item has been changed, but before the
 *                            state of the fragment is updated.
 *
 * @return   An [OriginBase] for this polymorphic auto list. Use this instance to change
 *           properties and to get connection info for the connecting peers.
