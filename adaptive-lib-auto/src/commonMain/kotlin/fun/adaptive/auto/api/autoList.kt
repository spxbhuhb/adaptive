/**
 * Connect to peers with [AutoApi] and produce a list that is
 * automatically synchronized between peers.
 *
 * - Adding/removing items from the list generate a new list instance (on all peers).
 * - Property changes (on any peer) generate a new list instance (on all peers).
 * - Property changes keep the non-affected instances.
 *
 * Each new instance is validated by default, so fragments that use values
 * produced by [autoList] can safely use the validation result as it is
 * up-to-date all the time.
 *
 * The list is **NOT** thread safe.
 *
 * @param    onListCommit       Called after the structure of the list has been changed (add/remove), but before the
 *                              state of the fragment is updated.
 * @param    onItemCommit       Called when a property of a list item has been changed, but before the
 *  *                           state of the fragment is updated.
 * @param    binding            Set by the compiler plugin, ignore it.
 * @param    connect            A function to get the connection info. Typically, this is created by
 *                              a service call.
 *
 * @return   `null` (it takes time to connect and synchronize)
