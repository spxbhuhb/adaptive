# Value Domain

Value domains in [Adaptive](def://) define a cohesive and self-contained environment for managing a group
of related [values](def://) within a [value store](def://). It encapsulates the [markers](def://), 
[reference labels](def://), [value statuses](def://) and structural rules necessary to 
operate on these values consistently and meaningfully.

Value domains serve to:

- Partition a global [value store](def://) into logical subspaces.
- Prevent naming collisions by namespacing [markers](def://), [reference labels](def://) and [value statuses](def://).
- Simplify the creation and interpretation of [value trees](def://) or similar hierarchical structures.
- Provide compile-time and [runtime](def://) structure for domain-specific operations via domain definitions.
