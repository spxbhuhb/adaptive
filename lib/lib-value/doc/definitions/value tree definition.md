# Value tree definition

Value tree definitions are formal descriptors that define how hierarchical relationships
are represented within a [value domain](def://) in Adaptive. It specifies the [markers](def://)
and [reference labels](def://) required to construct and traverse tree-like data
structures among [values](def://).

The value tree definitions serve as a reusable specification for:

- Constructing rooted or rootless [value trees](def://) with [value worker](def://) operations.
- Navigating parent-child relationships consistently across the domain.
- Applying transforms or validations on [value trees](def://) with predictable structure.
