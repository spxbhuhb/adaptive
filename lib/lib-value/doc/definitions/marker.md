# Marker

Markers label [values](def://) with type information.

Markers are similar to tags or labels, but they are domain-specific
and in many cases calculated by the system automatically.

For example, in the IoT domain, markers might be "temperature", "hot-water" etc.

The concept originates from [Project Haystack](https://project-haystack.org).
