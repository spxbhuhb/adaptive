# Value reference

A [value reference](def://) uni-directional pointer from the [referring value](def://) to the [referred value](def://).

Each reference has a [reference label](def://) which describes what kind of reference it is. For example,
"parentRef" would mean that the [referring value](def://) is the child of the [referred value](def://).
