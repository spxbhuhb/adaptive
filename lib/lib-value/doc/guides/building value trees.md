# Building value trees

[Values](def://) in a [value store](def://) can be organized into value trees. This relies on the
proper uses of markers and on the [AvRefListSpec](class://) class.

To build a value tree, you need to designate two markers and two reference labels:

Markers:

- one for the [values](def://) that are nodes in the tree
- one for the [values](def://) that contain lists of children references

Reference labels:

- one for referencing the parent node
- one for referencing the [value](def://) that contains the list of children references

## Example

For example, let's assume we want to build a tree of spaces that represent a building.

In this case:

- the `space` marker marks all nodes of the tree
- the `sub-spaces` marker marks [values](def://) that contain an [AvRefListSpec](class://)
- the `parentSpace` reference label references the parent node
- the `subSpaces` reference label points to the [value](def://) which contains an [AvRefListSpec](class://)
