# Tool pane

Tool pane is a subtype of [pane](def://) that shows an [MPW tool](def://) in a [multi-pane workspace](def://). 

In many cases tools let the user add a [content pane](def://) to the [multi-pane workspace](def://). For
example, a documentation browser tool may let the user open a section of the documentation.

Tool panes typically consist of three parts: 

- a [UI fragment](def://) that renders the pane
- a [view backend](def://) that contains the logic of the pane
- a [pane definition](def://) that defines the pane for the [multi-pane workspace](def://)
