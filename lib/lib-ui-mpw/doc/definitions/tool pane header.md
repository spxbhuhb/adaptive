# Tool pane header

Tool pane headers are the top-most part of a [tool pane](def://) that display the name
of the tool, the [tool pane actions](def://) the tool provides and an icon that hides the tool.

Tool pane headers are optional, but in most cases are shown to let the user which tool is
on the screen.
