# Content pane

Content pane is a subtype of [pane](def://) that shows a rendering of some actual content such 
as a section of documentation, a table of items, source code, etc.

Content panes typically consist of three parts: 

- a [UI fragment](def://) that renders the pane
- a [view backend](def://) that contains the logic of the pane
- a [pane definition](def://) that defines the pane for the [multi-pane workspace](def://)

Content panes are usually part of a [content pane group](def://), and they sometimes
interact with [tool panes](def://).
