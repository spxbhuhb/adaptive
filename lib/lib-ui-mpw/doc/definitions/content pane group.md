# Content pane group

Content pane groups contain [content panes](def://) of a [multi-pane workspace](def://).

Each content pane group has to contain at least one [content pane](def://).

When a content pane group contains more than one [content pane](def://), only
one [content pane](def://) shows, and the pane group displays tabs on the top
to let the user switch between the panes in the group. 

Content pane groups are shown in the center area of the [multi-pane workspace](def://)
