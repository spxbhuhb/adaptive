# MPW content

MPW contents are [multi-pane workspace](def://) components that display main
content to the user and let the user interact with that content.

The difference between [MPW tools](def://) and MPW content is that [MPW tools](def://) are
logically on the sideline while MPW content is at the center of attention.

MPW contents typically register [content panes](def://) with the workspace.
