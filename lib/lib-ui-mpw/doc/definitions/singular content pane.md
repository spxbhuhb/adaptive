# Singular content pane

Singular content panes are a subtype of [content panes](def://) that show the same item 
every time they are loaded.

For example, a pane that lets the user edit his/her own account settings is a
singular pane as there is logically only one account for each user. In contrast,
a pane that shows a section of the documentation is non-singular as it can be 
reused to show different sections.
