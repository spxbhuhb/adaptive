# Tool pane action

Tool pane actions are actions displayed in the [tool pane header](def://) to let 
users execute functions the given tool provides.

For example, if the tool displays a tree, the "collapse all" and "expand all" actions
are provided for user convenience.

Tool pane actions are typically defined in the [view backend](def://) of the [tool pane](def://).
