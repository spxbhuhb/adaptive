# Paragraph

Paragraph is a fragment that arranges instances of [AbstractParagraphItem](class://) into
a width-restricted flow.

The paragraph has a list of styles (instance of [AdaptiveInstructionGroup](class://)), and 
each item selects one of those styles to use.

Both the styles and the items are passed in a [ParagraphViewBackend](class://).
