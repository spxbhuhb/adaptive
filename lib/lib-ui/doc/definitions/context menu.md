# Context menu

Context menu is a [UI fragment](def://) that presents a set of actions relevant to the current state 
or selection in the user interface. Typically triggered by user interaction such as click 
or long-press, it displays a temporary menu near the point of interaction.

Context menus in Adaptive are rendered using overlay fragments (rootBox), enabling 
them to appear above other content without affecting the layout of the surrounding fragments.
