# View backend

View backends provide data storage and logic for [ui fragments](def://). In the model-view-controller
terminology they are the model and the controller merged into one class.

Many [ui fragments](def://) in [Adaptive](def://) have a `viewBackend` parameter that is the
view backend the fragment requires.
