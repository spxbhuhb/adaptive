# Modal popup

A modal popup is a [UI fragment](def://) that appears on top of an application's main content, temporarily 
disabling interaction with the underlying [user interface](def://) until the popup is dismissed.

It typically requires a user action to close and is used to display important information, gather input, or confirm actions.
