# lib-ui

`lib-ui` is a [subproject](def://) of [Adaptive](def://) that provides sophisticated
[UI fragments](def://) for building [user interfaces](def://).

`lib-ui` uses the low-level features provided by [core-ui](def://) and adds styling,
behavior, data handling, etc.

`lib-ui` is intended to be the main UI toolkit for [Adaptive](def://)-based application
development, with some very high-level features (such as charts, documents) moved
to their own [subproject](def://).
