# Xlsx

Xlsx is a very simple implementation of a Microsoft Excel Open XML Spreadsheet writer
which can be used to build Xlsx files, mostly for download.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a rather old implementation I've just copied and pasted from an old project,
> it is nowhere close to a full XLSX implementation. That said, it works and makes it
> very-very easy to generate a downloadable XLSX file on-the-fly.
> 
> Also, as with everything, it is 100% pure Kotlin and available on all platforms.
> (Though I do not have any idea what happens with the actual download on-non browser, 
> should check that).
