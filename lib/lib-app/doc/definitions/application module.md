# Application Module

An application module is a collection of components (UI and server[fragments](def://),
[resources](def://) etc.) that can be added to an [application](def://).

Each application module has an [application module definition](def://), which is a Kotlin
class that is a descendant of [AppModule](class://).

Application modules are typically added to the [application](def://) by the
[application entry function](def://).
