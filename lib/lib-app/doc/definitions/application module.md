# Application Module

An [application module](def://) is a collection of components (UI and server[fragments](def://),
[resources](def://) etc.) that can be added to an [application](def://).

Each [application module](def://) has an [application module definition](def://), which is a Kotlin
class that is a descendant of [AppModule](class://).

[Application modules](def://) are typically added to the [application](def://) by the
[application entry function](def://).
