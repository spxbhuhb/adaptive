# Application module definition

Application module definitions are classes that define and register features offered by [application modules](def://).
They are descendants of the [AppModule](class://) class and are typically instantiated in an [application entry function](def://).

These include [adat classes](def://), [resources](def://), [fragments](def://), [backend fragment implementations](def://)
contained in the module.
