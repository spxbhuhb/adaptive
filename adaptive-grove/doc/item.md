# Item

Sheet items are:

- the fragments the user edits
- stored in `SheetViewController.items`
- instances of `SheetItem`

- Each item has a unique `index` which is the index in `SheetViewController.items`.
- `SheetViewController.nextIndex` is used to get the next index.
- When put on the clipboard, `SheetClipboardItem` stores copied data.

These operations add new items:

- `Add`
- `Paste`
- `Group`
- `Undo`
- `Redo`

These operations mark items removed:

- `Remove`
- `Cut`
- `Ungroup`
- `Undo`
- `Redo`

## Item lifecycle

Main events of the item lifecycle:

1. The item is created. This is a one-time operation, cannot be reversed.
2. The item is shown: additions and undo of removals.
3. The item is hidden: removals and undo of additions.

Creation of an item use `SheetController.createItem`:

- creates an instance of `SheetItem`
- adds the created instance ot `SheetViewController.items`

Additions and undo of removals use `SheetViewController.showItem`:

- sets `SheetItem.removed` to false
- sets group of the item
- sets members if the item is a group
  - also sets `group` for all members
- adds all removed links to the other items
- adds the fragment by calling `GroveDrawingLayer.plusAssign`

Removes and undo of additions use `SheetViewController.hideItem`:

- keeps the item in `SheetViewController.items`
- backups the item information into `SheetItem.beforeRemove`
  - can be used by undo/redo
- set `SheetItem.removed` to true
- clears the group of the item
- clears the members of the item if it is a group
- removes all links to the removed item from other items
- removes the fragment by calling `GroveDrawingLayer.minusAssign`

## Editing

Editor types by access:

- value based: displayed on the instructions or on the mapping panel
- control based: control layer interaction (move, resize, arrange etc.)
- inline: opened by double-clicking on an item 

Editor registries in `SheetViewModel`:

| Registry                    | Access          | Reference         | Class                    |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| `controlRegistry`           | control         | model-key         | `SheetControl`           |
| `instructionEditorRegistry` | value           | instruction class | `SheetInstructionEditor` |
| `mappingEditorRegistry`     | value or inline | model-key         | `SheetMappingEditor`     |

Editor lookup runs on:

- select (control and value)
- double-click (inline)

Editor selection:

- by reference if provided 
- by calling the `matches` function of the editor registry entry (only if no reference is provided)

When items are selected:

- the instructions pane shows the instruction editors
- the mapping pane shows the mapping value editors
- the control layer shows the controls

On double-click:

- if the target of the click is a group, in-group selection runs
- if the target is not a group:
  - the inline editor opens
  - the selection does not change

Multi-item behaviour:

- union of instructions shows
  - fields for conflicting values are empty
  - fields for equal values display the value
- mapping editor shows only when a single item is selected
