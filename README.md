Full-stack application development library, focusing on:

* intentional coding (just write down what you want in a short, concise way)
* clean code
* no-boilerplate

Adaptive comes with a compiler plugin that performs many functions reach the goals above.

Status: **migrating the code from the old proof-of-concept project**

# Modules

- [Base](doc/base/README.md) reactive software fragment library
- [Services](doc/services/README.md) transparent client-server communication with simple function calls
- [Schematic] data model definition
- [WireFormat](doc/wireformat/README.md) lightweight serialization (JSON, Protobuf) optimized for RPC

# Artifacts

The modules are spread over the three artifacts the library provides:

* [Core] fundamental code necessary for the compiler plugin to work with
* [Plugin] the compiler plugin that performs all the code transformations
* [Lib] application level code that uses Core and Plugin

# Building Adaptive

Run the `build` task of the root project.

Building the project publishes the Kotlin compiler plugin into the local Maven repository. This is necessary as `adaptive-lib`
needs the Kotlin plugin to compile. To publish into Maven local you have to set up the signing as documented in
[The Signing Plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/signing_plugin.html). Long story short, put the
following info into your `gradle.properties`:

```properties
signing.gnupg.executable=/usr/local/bin/gpg
signing.gnupg.keyName=<your-key-short-name>
```

Technically you don't need the executable but for me, it was necessary, I have no idea why.
