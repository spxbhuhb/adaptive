Adaptive is a consolidated application development library for Kotlin focusing on:

* expressing our intention,
* clean code, close to no-boilerplate, minimal dependencies,
* frontend and backend components with built-in lifecycle and state handling.

Adaptive comes with a compiler plugin that performs many functions to reach the goals above.

## Important

> Status: **preview**
>
> While library already works and provides both client and server side functionality,
> it is not even close to be ready for general production.
>
> Please note that this is just a preview release, many basic things you would expect to 
> work are still broken, especially around the code transformation.
> 
> For example, a simple `{ counter++ }` at the right place can result in a compiler plugin
> error.
> 
> I will clean everything up eventually, but for now I consider these low priority issues, 
> ones I can live with. If anyone starts to play around with the project I'll try to
> spend some time on these problems. Feel free to open an issue for any error or even 
> inconvenience you experience.

## Supported platforms

## Gradle Dependencies

**Note**: The snapshot version is not on Maven Central. I'll update this when an actual preview is released.

```text
plugins {
    kotlin("multiplatform") version "1.9.10"
    id("hu.simplexion.adaptive") version "2024.05.07-SNAPSHOT"
}

kotlin {
    sourceSets["commonMain"].dependencies {
        implementation("hu.simplexion.adaptive:adaptive-core:2024.05.07-SNAPSHOT")
        implementation("hu.simplexion.adaptive:adaptive-ktor:2024.05.07-SNAPSHOT")        
        implementation("hu.simplexion.adaptive:adaptive-exposed:2024.05.07-SNAPSHOT")
        implementation("hu.simplexion.adaptive:adaptive-email:2024.05.07-SNAPSHOT")
        implementation("hu.simplexion.adaptive:adaptive-ui:2024.05.07-SNAPSHOT")
    }
}
```

## Building Adaptive

If you are building with iOS targets you have to run the build on Mac OS X. This is a requirement from Apple,
see [Multiplatform Setup](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/multiplatform-setup.html) for details.

To disable iOS targets set the version of `ios-support` to `none` in [libs.versions.toml](gradle/libs.versions.toml). Any
value other than `none` adds support for iOS.

This is also useful when you don't want to wait for the iOS linking during development.

Run the `build` task of the root project.

Adaptive uses a composite Gradle build. These tasks are defined for the root project and run the appropriate task for
each included project:

- `build`
- `clean`
- `publishToMavenLocal`
- `kotlinUpgradeYarnLock`

Everything uses the dependencies defined in [libs.versions.toml](gradle/libs.versions.toml).

To bump Adaptive version number:

- change `adaptive` version in  [libs.versions.toml](gradle/libs.versions.toml)
- change `PLUGIN_VERSION` in [AdaptiveGradlePlugin](adaptive-gradle-plugin/src/main/kotlin/hu/simplexion/adaptive/gradle/AdaptiveGradlePlugin.kt) (also see https://github.com/spxbhuhb/adaptive/issues/7)

## Debugging Adaptive

To see what the plugin does, add this to `build.gradle.kts`. When `pluginDebug` is true, the plugin creates
files for each compilation in the `pluginLogDir` directory.

```kotlin
adaptive {
    pluginDebug = true
    pluginLogDir = projectDir.toPath()
}
```
