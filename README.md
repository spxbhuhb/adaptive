Adaptive is a consolidated application development library for Kotlin focusing on:

* expressing our intention,
* clean code, close to no-boilerplate, minimal dependencies,
* frontend and backend components with built-in lifecycle and state handling.

Adaptive comes with a compiler plugin that performs many functions to reach the goals above.

Status: **initial development**

While the library already works and provides both client and server side functionality it
is not ready for general production yet. I am working continuously to add improvements.

Supported platforms:

* JVM
* Browser/JS
* Android
* iOS (Arm64, Simulator Arm64, X64)

See [platforms](./doc/platforms/README.md) for details.

## Basic Concept

Adaptive has been inspired by [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and it basically serves the same purpose as other 
reactive frameworks such as Compose or React. However, there are a few key differences:

* also supports building of servers, not just user interfaces
* all variables are reactive by default (there is no `remember`)
* there is no recomposition/re-rendering, instead fragments are "patched"

Here is a very simple server and a very simple client:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    
    adaptive(AdaptiveServerAdapter<Any>(true)) {
    
        settings { propertyFile { "./etc/example.properties" } }

        service { CounterService() }
        worker { CounterWorker() }

        worker { KtorWorker() }

    }
    
}
```

```kotlin
val counterService = getService<CounterApi>()

fun now() = Clock.System.now()

fun main() {
    defaultServiceCallTransport = BasicWebSocketServiceCallTransport()

    adaptive(AdaptiveDOMAdapter()) {
        val time = poll(1.seconds, now()) { now() }
        counterWithTime(time)
    }
}

@Adaptive
fun counterWithTime(time : Instant) {
    val counter = poll(1.seconds, 0) { counterService.incrementAndGet() }
    text("$time $counter")
}
```

## Gradle Dependencies

**Note**: The snapshot version is not on Maven Central. I'll update this when an actual preview is released.

```text
plugins {
    kotlin("multiplatform") version "1.9.10"
    id("hu.simplexion.adaptive") version "2024.05.07-SNAPSHOT"
}

kotlin {
    sourceSets["commonMain"].dependencies {
        implementation("hu.simplexion.adaptive:adaptive-core:2024.05.07-SNAPSHOT")
        implementation("hu.simplexion.adaptive:adaptive-ktor:2024.05.07-SNAPSHOT")        
        implementation("hu.simplexion.adaptive:adaptive-exposed:2024.05.07-SNAPSHOT")
        implementation("hu.simplexion.adaptive:adaptive-email:2024.05.07-SNAPSHOT")
        implementation("hu.simplexion.adaptive:adaptive-ui:2024.05.07-SNAPSHOT")
    }
}
```

## Building Adaptive

Run the `build` task of the root project.

Building the project publishes the Kotlin compiler plugin into the local Maven repository. This is necessary as `adaptive-lib`
needs the Kotlin plugin to compile. To publish into Maven local you have to set up the signing as documented in
[The Signing Plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/signing_plugin.html). Long story short, put the
following info into your `gradle.properties`:

```properties
signing.gnupg.executable=/usr/local/bin/gpg
signing.gnupg.keyName=<your-key-short-name>
```

Theoretically you don't need the executable, but for me, it was necessary, I have no idea why.

## Debugging Adaptive

To see what the plugin does, add this to `build.gradle.kts`. When `pluginDebug` is true, the plugin creates
files for each compilation in the `pluginLogDir` directory.

```kotlin
adaptive {
    pluginDebug = true
    pluginLogDir = projectDir.toPath()
}
```
