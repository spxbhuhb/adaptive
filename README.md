> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> Adaptive uses the K2 compiler heavily. Starting from IntelliJ IDEA 2024.2 K2 support is available for multiplatform
> projects. To have it, you have to enable K2 and the non-bundled plugins.
>
> 1. Enable K2:
>   1. Settings
>   2. Languages & Frameworks
>   3. Kotlin
>   4. Enable K2 mode
> 2. Enable 3rd party compiler plugins in the IntelliJ registry
>   1. https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KTIJ-29248/K2-IDE-Enable-non-bundled-compiler-plugins-in-IDE-by-default
>   2. `Shift-Shift` 
>   3. select `Actions` on top
>   4. type in `Registry`
>   5. find `kotlin.k2.only.bundled.compiler.plugins.enabled` and set it OFF
> 
> Technically you could avoid the registry setting by adding some boilerplate manually, but I think it's just
> easier to have it. Also, the issue above is scheduled for 2024.3, so hopefully this setting won't be needed
> anymore.
