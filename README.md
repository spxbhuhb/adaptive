Adaptive is a consolidated application development library for Kotlin focusing on:

* expressing our intention,
* clean code, close to no-boilerplate, minimal dependencies,
* frontend and backend components with built-in lifecycle and state handling.

Adaptive comes with a compiler plugin that performs many functions to reach the goals above.

  * [worker implementation](https://github.com/spxbhuhb/adaptive-example/blob/main/server/src/main/kotlin/CounterWorker.kt) (background worker, one (or few) instances per server)
* client
  * [shared code](https://github.com/spxbhuhb/adaptive-example/blob/main/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/counter.kt) (shared between all client platforms)
  * [browser main](https://github.com/spxbhuhb/adaptive-example/blob/main/browserApp/src/jsMain/kotlin/main.kt)
  * [android main](https://github.com/spxbhuhb/adaptive-example/blob/main/androidApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/hu/simplexion/adaptive/example/MainActivity.kt)

## Build

1. Add `local.propeties` file to
   1. `adaptive-core`
   2. `adaptive-ui/adaptive-ui-common`
   3. `adaptive-sandbox`
1. Run the `build` task of the root project.

> [!Note]
>
> If you are building with iOS targets you have to run the build on Mac OS X. This is a requirement from Apple,
> see [Multiplatform Setup](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/multiplatform-setup.html) for details.
>
> To disable iOS targets set the version of `ios-support` to `none` in [libs.versions.toml](gradle/libs.versions.toml). Any
> value other than `none` adds support for iOS.
>
> This is also useful when you don't want to wait for the iOS linking during development.

Adaptive uses a composite Gradle build. These tasks are defined for the root project and run the appropriate task for
each included project:

- `build`
- `clean`
- `publishToMavenLocal`
- `kotlinUpgradeYarnLock`

Everything uses the dependencies defined in [libs.versions.toml](gradle/libs.versions.toml).

To bump Adaptive version number:

- change `adaptive` version in  [libs.versions.toml](gradle/libs.versions.toml)
- change `PLUGIN_VERSION` in [AdaptiveGradlePlugin](adaptive-gradle-plugin/src/main/kotlin/hu/simplexion/adaptive/gradle/AdaptiveGradlePlugin.kt) (also see https://github.com/spxbhuhb/adaptive/issues/7)

## Debug

To see what the plugin does, add this to `build.gradle.kts`. When `pluginDebug` is true, the plugin creates
files for each compilation in the `pluginLogDir` directory.

```kotlin
adaptive {
    pluginDebug = true
    pluginLogDir = projectDir.toPath()
}
```
