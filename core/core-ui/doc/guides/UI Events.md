# UI Events

UI events are handled by adding an [event instruction](guide://) to a fragment.

Some fragments such as [button](guide://) do this automatically, and you only
have to supply a callback function.

All event handlers get a [UIEvent](class://) instance when called, and this instance
contains all the information that belongs to the event.
