# Scrolling

Scrolling and scrollbar styling is a problematic topic, especially in browsers.

You can add scrolling to a container with any of these instructions:

```kotlin
verticalScroll
horizontalScroll
scroll
```

To have scrolling work properly, you have to limit the size of the container in the
scroll direction at least.

When adding scroll, pay attention to where you add the instruction.

This works, as you apply scroll to the column that contains the big stuff.

```kotlin
@Adaptive
fun a() {
    column {
        scroll
        bigStuff()
    }
}

@Adaptive
fun bigStuff() {
    box(size(10000.dp, 10000.dp)) {  }
}
```

This **DOES NOT WORK**. The reason is that the `box` is already big. It does not need
to be scrolled to contain everything. The column that contains `bigStuff` is small,
the content of that column has to be scrolled.

```kotlin
import `fun`.adaptive.foundation.Adaptive
import `fun`.adaptive.ui.api.scroll

@Adaptive
fun a() {
    column {
        bigStuff()
    }
}

@Adaptive 
fun bigStuff() {
    box(size(10000.dp, 10000.dp)) {
        scroll
        throw RuntimeException("THIS DOES NOT WORK")
    }
}
```

## Scrollbar style in browsers

When a scroll instructions are added to the fragment, `AuiAdapter.applyLayoutToActual`
applies these CSS styles:

- `overflow` to `auto` (in the respective direction)
- `scrollbar-gutter` to `stable`

Mechanisms:

- For non-macOs platforms, the `custom-scrollbar` CSS class is added to the root element of the adapter.
- Size of the scrollbar is measured with `getScrollbarWidth` during adapter initialization.
- `box`, `row` and `column` layouts subtract this size from the available space when the container has a scrolling instruction. 

The `custom-scrollbar` CSS class is typically defined in `index.html`:

```css
.custom-scrollbar::-webkit-scrollbar {
    width: 7px;
    height: 7px;
}

.custom-scrollbar::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
    border-radius: 3.5px;
}
```
