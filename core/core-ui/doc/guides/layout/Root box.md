# Root Box

[rootBox](fragment://) is the same as [box](fragment://) with one key difference: it is added
directly to the [root container](def://) instead of the parent fragment.

[rootBox](fragment://) can be used for popups, modals, snacks and other UI components that should
be placed outside the normal [ui layout](def://).
