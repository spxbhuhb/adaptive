# core-ui

`core-ui` is a core [subproject](def://) of [Adaptive](def://) that provides basic features 
for building [user interfaces](def://) such as [UI layout](def://), [UI rendering](def://)
and low-level [UI fragments](def://).

Almost all [platform-dependent](def://) [user interface](def://) code is placed in `core-ui`.

While it is possible to build a [user interface](def://) purely with `core-ui` it is usually
better to use the higher level fragments from [lib-ui](def://).
