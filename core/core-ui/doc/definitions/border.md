# Border

Border is the visual boundary layer between the [margin](def://) and the [padding](def://) of 
a [UI fragment](def://). It defines the edge of the visible element and may include visual 
styles such as color, thickness, and shape(e.g., rounded corners).

Border is included in the size of the fragment.

Border is optional, many fragments do not have any borders at all. The
border size is specified by four [device independent pixel](def://) values one 
for each side of the fragment: top, right, bottom and left.

[Adaptive](def://) defines a number of [ui instructions](def://) to define the
borders for a [UI fragment](def://).

Border is part of the [layout surrounding](def://) of the fragment.
