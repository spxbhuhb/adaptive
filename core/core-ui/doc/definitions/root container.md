# Root container

Root container is the top-most container of [UI fragments](def://) in a [UI fragment tree](def://) 
that is handled by a [UI adapter](def://) directly.

The root container is typically closely related to the [actual UI](def://) providing an entry point
for the [user interface](def://).

The size of the root container is determined by the [UI adapter](def://), usually by using a [platform-dependent](def://)
function to get the width and the length.
