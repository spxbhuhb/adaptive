# UI instruction

A UI instruction is a type of [instruction](def://) that specifically influences the styling,
layout, or behavior of [ui fragments](def://). 

These instructions are used to control how UI elements are rendered, arranged within
[UI container fragments](def://), and how they respond to user interactions. While
instructions can be applied to any fragment, they primarily affect rendering when
passed to [actual UI fragments](def://) like text or row.
