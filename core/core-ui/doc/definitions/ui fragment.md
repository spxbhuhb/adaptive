# UI Fragment

A UI fragment is a [fragment](def://) that is a part of a [user interface](def://).

There are three main categories of UI fragments: [independent ui fragment](def://),
[expect ui fragment](def://) and [dependent ui fragment](def://).

[Expect UI fragments](def://) and [dependent UI fragments](def://) are typically 
bound to an [actual UI](def://) and have [render data](def://) associated with it. 

[Independent UI fragments](def://) do not have [render data](def://) and are not bound to [actual UIs](def://).
