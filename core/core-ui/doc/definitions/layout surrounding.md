# Layout surrounding

Layout surrounding is the space around a [UI fragment](def://) composed of
its [margin](def://), [padding](def://) and [border](def://).

During [ui layout](def://) calculations the surrounding is subtracted from
the space available for the fragment when creating a [sizing proposal](def://)
for the children of the fragment.

During [ui rendering](def://) the [padding](def://) is filled with the background
of the fragment and [borders](def://) are drawn.
