# Padding

Padding is the innermost spacing around a [UI fragment](def://). It is 
filled with the background of the fragment and is included in the size
of the fragment.

Padding is optional, many fragments do not have any paddings at all. The
padding is specified by four [device independent pixel](def://) values, one 
for each side of the fragment: top, right, bottom and left.

[Adaptive](def://) defines a number of [ui instructions](def://) to define the
padding values for a [UI fragment](def://).

Padding is part of the [layout surrounding](def://) of the fragment.
