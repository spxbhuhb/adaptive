# Decoration instruction

Decoration instructions are a subtype of [UI instructions](def://) that change how a
[UI fragment](def://) looks.

These instructions, except for `border`, do not affect the [UI layout](def://). They typically
define coloring, background, etc.

Border is a special case where a decoration is also part of the [layout surrounding](def://).
