# Device independent pixel

A device independent pixel is a virtual unit of measurement used in [ui layout](def://) 
and [ui rendering](def://) that represents a physical size on screen that stays consistent 
across devices, regardless of screen resolution or pixel density.

[ui instructions](def://) use device independent pixels to ensure consistent look and
[ui adapters](def://) offer features to convert device independent pixels into 
actual screen pixels and vice-versa.
