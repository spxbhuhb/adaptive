# Device independent pixel

Device independent pixel is a virtual unit of measurement used in [UI layout](def://) 
and [UI rendering](def://) that represents a physical size on screen that stays consistent 
across devices, regardless of screen resolution or pixel density.

[UI instructions](def://) use device independent pixels to ensure consistent look and
[UI adapters](def://) offer features to convert device independent pixels into 
actual screen pixels and vice-versa.

`dp` is short for device independent pixel, `2.dp` means two device independent pixels.
