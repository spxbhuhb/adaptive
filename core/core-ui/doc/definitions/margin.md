# Margin

Margin is the outermost spacing around a [UI fragment](def://). It is not 
filled with the background of the fragment but is **included in the size**
of the fragment.

Margin is optional, many fragments do not have any margins at all. The
margin is specified by four [device independent pixel](def://) values, one 
for each side of the fragment: top, right, bottom and left.

[Adaptive](def://) defines a number of [ui instructions](def://) to define the
margin values for a [UI fragment](def://).
