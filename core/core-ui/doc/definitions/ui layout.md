# UI Layout

A UI layout is a way [UI fragments](def://) are arranged and positioned within
a [UI container fragment](def://), such as a [column](fragment://) or [row](fragment://).

It's the logic or structure that determines the visual presentation and spatial 
relationship of multiple [UI fragments](def://) when they are grouped together.

Layout behavior is often controlled by applying [ui instructions](def://) to the [UI container fragments](def://).

In essence, layouts are responsible for the placement and sizing of UI elements composed of fragments.
