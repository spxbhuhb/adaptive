# Random access

Random access refers to a method when parts of some binary data are accessed randomly.

For example, reading from the middle, then writing the end, then reading from the start.

Random access is typically used with some kind of [persistence](def://), such as files
or database BLOB objects. These usually offer random access to optimize modifications and retrieval.
