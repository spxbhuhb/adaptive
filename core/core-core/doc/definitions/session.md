# Session

A session refers to a temporary and interactive information exchange between a [client application](def://)
and a [server application](def://).

Sessions are used to maintain state and track user activity across multiple [service function](def://) calls.

A session is created when the client signs in and is removed when the client signs out or is 
inactive for a given time period.

[service function](def://) implementations can access the session of the call through the [service context](def://).
