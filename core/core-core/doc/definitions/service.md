A service is a distinct unit of functionality or a set of capabilities exposed by one [application](def://)
for consumption by other [applications](def://) or components. 

Each service has a [service API](def://) that defines the functions provided by the service

Services are commonly used for [server applications](def://) to provide functions to [client applications](def://),
but can also facilitate communication between [server applications](def://) or in some cases, for servers to call 
functions provided by [client applications](def://).
