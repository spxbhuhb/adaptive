# Platform

A platform refers to the underlying platform the code runs on, such as Browser, Android, iOS or JVM.

These platforms offer similar functionality but in different ways. For example, each platform
provides components to build a [user interface](def://) but the actual way it is built is very specific
for each platform.

Components that use platform-specific functionality are called [platform-dependent](def://).
