# Declaring fragment

A declaring fragment refers to the [fragment](def://) that contains the logic responsible 
for creating and [patching](def://) of its descendant fragments.

For [hard-coded fragments](def://), this is the fragment defined by its [original function](def://).
For [no-code fragments](def://), it is the fragment that actualizes the no-code data into concrete child fragments.

Conceptually, a declaring fragment holds the knowledge of how to update and patch 
the fragments that are declared within its scope.
