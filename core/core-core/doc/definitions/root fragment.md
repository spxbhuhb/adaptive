# Root fragment

Root fragments are [fragments](def://) on the top of a [fragment tree](def://). They do 
not have a parent fragment, and typically the [adapter](def://) is responsible for
managing them.

In case of [user interfaces](def://) root fragments are used to implement layering, such 
as notifications or modal dialogs above the normal UI.
