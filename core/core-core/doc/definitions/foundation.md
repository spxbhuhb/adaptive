# Foundation

The foundation of [Adaptive](def://) is a reactive framework [applications](guide://) use
to build their internal state and [user interface](guide://).

This framework is fully independent of any others like Compose or React. It is coded
fully in Kotlin and supports integration with underlying [platforms](def://) through
[adapters](guide://) and [platform-dependent](def://) [fragments](def://).
