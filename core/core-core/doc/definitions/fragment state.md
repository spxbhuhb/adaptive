# Fragment state

The state of a [fragment](def://) is defined as an array of the [state variables](def://)
that belong to the fragment.

The fragment state represents all the runtime data associated with the fragment, 
in case of [ui fragments](def://) changing the state typically re-renders the fragment.

By definition, the first state variable of all fragments is the group of [instructions](def://)
passed to the fragment.
