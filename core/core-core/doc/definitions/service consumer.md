# Service consumer

A service consumer is an instance that can call functions defined by a [service API](def://).
It's the client-side representation that allows an [application](def://) or component to interact
with a [service](def://) provided by another [application](def://), typically a [server application](def://).

The [compiler plugin](def://) automatically generates the code for service consumers.
