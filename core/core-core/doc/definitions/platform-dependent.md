# Platform-dependent

In [Adaptive](def://) platform-dependent means that the given component can be used only on
the given [platform](def://).

Platform-dependent components typically provide a bridge between the platform-independent components and the
actual underlying [platform](def://).

[Adaptive](def://) tries to use the minimum number of platform-dependent components, so the code is free of
bounding dependencies.
