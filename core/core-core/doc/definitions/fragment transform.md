# Fragment transform

A fragment transform is a process of transforming a [fragment](def://) into another **in place**, for example, 
changing the instructions of a fragment.

Transforms range from very simple (change the background color) to very complex (reorder the columns of a table
by colum name).

[Adaptive](def://) offers various built-in transforms that can be used to transform fragments, thereby modifying 
application behavior and/or [user interface](def://) while the application is running (i.e., during [runtime](def://)).
