# External state variable

A [state variable](def://) that is external to the fragment. These cannot be changed 
by the fragment directly (but the parent fragment can provide a function that changes 
them indirectly).

For [hard-coded fragments](def://) external state variables are the parameters of 
the [original function](def://).
