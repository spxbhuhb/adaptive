# Resource

A resource is a non-executable data needed by an [application](def://) during runtime.

These are typically static files or data structures bundled with the application package, such as images, 
strings for localization, icons, fonts, or other raw data. 

Accessing a resource usually involves loading it through a library-provided mechanism.
