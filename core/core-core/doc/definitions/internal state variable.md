# Internal state variable

A [state variable](def://) that is internal to the fragment. These can be changed only by the fragment 
itself or by its children.

For [hard-coded fragments](def://) the internal state variables are the Kotlin variables declared 
inside the [original function](def://) of the [fragment](def://).
