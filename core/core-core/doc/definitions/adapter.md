# Adapter

Adapters are managers of [fragment trees](def://), as such they are fundamental for
the working of any Adaptive [application](def://).

In the case of UI adapters, they act as a bridge between the low-level, platform-dependent UI
and the abstract, Adaptive [fragment](def://) based UI.

Each [fragment](def://) belongs to an adapter (it is impossible to create a fragment without an adapter).
