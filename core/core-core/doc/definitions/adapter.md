# Adapter

Adapters are managers of [fragment](def://) trees, as such they are fundamental for
the working of any Adaptive application.

In the case of UI adapters, they act as a bridge between the low-level, platform-dependent UI
and the abstract, Adaptive [fragment](def://) based UI.

Each [fragment](def://) belongs to an adapter (it is impossible to create a fragment without an adapter).
