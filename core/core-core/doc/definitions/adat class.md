# Adat class

A data model, defined by a Kotlin class (hard-coded data model) and/or by [adat metadata](def://) (no-code data model).

The [compiler plugin](def://) calculates the [adat metadata](def://) for hard coded adat classes.

These provide many advanced functions such as deep copy, difference calculation, reflection.
