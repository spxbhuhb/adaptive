# Fragment tree

A fragment tree is a hierarchical data structure used to organize related [fragments](def://).
In this structure, fragments are arranged with a single root fragment at the top, and child 
fragments linked to a single parent fragment, forming a tree. Fragment trees are managed 
and presented by [Adapters](def://).
