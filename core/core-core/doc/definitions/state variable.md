# State variable

State variables of a [fragment](def://) hold the runtime data of the fragment.

Together, they compose the [fragment state](def://).

When changed, the [patching](def://) mechanism is executed, which results in
all dependencies and outputs (such as a [user interface](def://)) being updated.
