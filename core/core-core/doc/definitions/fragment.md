# Fragment

Fragments are the fundamental building blocks of Adaptive applications.

Adaptive applications (both clients and servers) build fragment trees that 
store the state of the application.

The fragments and the trees built from fragments are **reactive**. When something
changes, the application will react to the change according to the code of the fragment.

Each fragment tree has an [adapter](def://) which manages the tree.
