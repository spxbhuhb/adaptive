# Fragment key

Fragment keys are strings that identify the type of the given fragment.

They typically consist of a namespace and name, such as `aui:row`, where `aui` 
is the namespace and `row` is the name, but there are no actual rules for fragment key structure.

Fragment keys are [supposedly unique](def://) and are used to find the class/resource when 
creating new fragments.
