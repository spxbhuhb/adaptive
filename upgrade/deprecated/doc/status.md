# Status

The project is in **preview** status:

* Many-many things already work and even more don't.
* Changes happen on daily basis, no compatibility is maintained at this stage.
* I try to keep the documentation up-to-date, but no promises.

I feel that the library reached the point when it is possible to write actual
applications with it.

In the next few months that (actual applications) will be the main focus as
I actually have to deliver those applications to customers.

I expect the library to mature during this period. Hopefully by the end of
the year it will be ready for general use.
