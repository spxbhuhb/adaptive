# Kotlin Writer

A very-very minimal implementation of a Kotlin writer package, similar to [KotlinPoet](https://square.github.io/kotlinpoet/).

The approach is a bit different and influenced more from Kotlin IR than from the spec concept. 

That said, this is nowhere close to a full implementation, I added only what I needed for resource code generation.

It is very easy to extend, so I'll just add whatever is missing at the time.
