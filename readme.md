Adaptive is a new take on Kotlin Multiplatform, a greenfield development with the goal
to let us comfortably write full-stack, pure-Kotlin applications without relying
on third-party, platform-dependent libraries.

I know that writing everything myself is a controversial topic, and many will
say: "Don't reinvent the wheel."

While there's some truth to that, let me ask you:

* Do today's 40-ton trucks run on the wooden wheels of medieval wagons?
* Why are there 3 million packages on NPM?

I honestly believe that removing the complexity added by dependencies brings extreme
benefits, especially considering AI code assistants. Also, this approach lets new
programmers enter the Kotlin world without learning everything that is needed for
a full-stack application.

Currently, Adaptive is under the initial development, not ready for the broader 
public. It only includes what I’ve needed so far, I’ve taken some shortcuts,
and—to be honest—I’ve made some bad decisions along the way that I haven’t fixed yet.

That said, it works, and the list of features already implemented is really-really long.
