Adaptive is a consolidated application platform for Kotlin Multiplatform.

The goal of the project is to let me comfortably write full-stack, pure-Kotlin applications without
relying on third-party libraries.

I know that writing everything myself is a controversial topic, and many will say, "Don't reinvent the wheel."
While there's some truth to that, let me ask you this: do F1 race cars run on the wooden wheels of
medieval wagons?

Currently, Adaptive is not ready for the broader public. It only includes what I’ve needed so far, 
I’ve taken some shortcuts, and—to be honest—I’ve made some bad decisions along the way that I haven’t fixed yet.

That said, it works, and the list of features already implemented is really-really long.
