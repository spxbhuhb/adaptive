Adaptive is (or in some cases, will be) many things:

- *is* a friendly leaf
- *is* a reactive server and UI framework for multiplatform
- *will be* a truly integrated development environment (TIDE)
- *will be* a low-code application development system for Kotlin Multiplatform
- *almost is* a tool for building live documentation and presentations
- *almost is* a documentation-first project methodology
- *is* an IoT appliction that uses everything above

I've tried to communicate this project to the Kotlin community but I'm not really good at that. 
After some bad experiences I've decided not to care about the community at all.

You can see a live (if somewhat outdated) demo on [adaptive.fun](https://adaptive.fun).
