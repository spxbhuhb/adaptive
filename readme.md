Adaptive is a fresh approach to Kotlin Multiplatform, a greenfield development with the
goal of comfortably writing full-stack, pure-Kotlin applications without relying 
on third-party, platform-dependent libraries.

Currently, Adaptive is under initial development and not yet ready for broader public use.
I've started the process to push the project into a public beta phase, but it will 
likely take a few months to reach that point.

## Compatibility matrix

Adaptive is currently a "bleeding-edge" project. This means the focus is on new features
and refactoring (when needed) rather than stability.

While this may change in the future, we do not currently guarantee API stability.

**NOTE**: Snapshot releases are available for 90 days as per Maven Central policy.

**NOTE**: Versions of dependencies in snapshot releases may change without notice.
