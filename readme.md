[What is Adaptive](https://medium.com/@tiz_26128/what-is-adaptive-3b6d7366c56e)

I've tried to communicate this project to the Kotlin community, but I'm not really good at that. 
After some bad experiences I've decided not to care about the community at all. At the end Adaptive
is basically just a personal project of mine.

There are some documentation here and there (but it is somewhat outdated).

You can see a live (but quite outdated) demo on [adaptive.fun](https://adaptive.fun).
