Turning an idea into a working software application is a long and treacherous journey.

Today’s development landscape often feels like a jungle—dense, confusing, full of hidden 
pitfalls and lurking predators. It may look beautiful from a distance, like in movies 
or glossy documentation, but navigating it is a different story. You get stuck, lost, 
soaked, bitten and burned out.

So instead of hacking my way through the underbrush, I decided to fly over it. Kotlin Multiplatform 
is the engine, Adaptive is the airplane. With it, I can go wherever I want—fast, focused and without
getting lost in the jungle.

Adaptive is a consolidated application platform for Kotlin Multiplatform.

This is a personal project, built to support my own work and ideas around application 
development using Kotlin Multiplatform. It reflects my preferences, priorities and experiments 
in building a more coherent, streamlined development experience.

At this point, and for the foreseeable future, Adaptive is not a commercial or community-driven 
framework. I'm sharing it publicly in case others find the ideas or approach useful, but there is
no roadmap, team or formal support behind it.

Feel free to explore, get inspired or borrow concepts—but keep in mind: this is an airplane 
I built for my own travels.
