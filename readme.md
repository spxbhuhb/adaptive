Adaptive is a consolidated application platform for Kotlin Multiplatform.

This is a personal project, built to support my own work and ideas around application 
development using Kotlin Multiplatform. It reflects my preferences, priorities and experiments 
in building a more coherent, streamlined development experience.

At this point, and for the foreseeable future, Adaptive is not a commercial or community-driven 
framework. I'm sharing it publicly in case others find the ideas or approach useful, but there is
no roadmap, team or formal support behind it.

Feel free to explore, get inspired or borrow conceptsâ€”but keep in mind that what's above.
