# Instructions

A fragment may have so-called instructions. The best example is styling of UI fragments, but
instructions are not limited to styles.

Here, all the parameters of `row` are instructions. This is a mix of built-in and locally
defined instructions.

```kotlin
import hu.simplexion.adaptive.foundation.Adaptive

@Adaptive
fun someFun() {
    row(2.gridCol, greenGradient, cornerRadius8, AlignItems.Center, JustifyContent.Center) {
        text("Hello World!", white)
    }
}
```

## Inner instructions

You can put the instructions inside builder blocks, at the beginning, before any rendering instructions.
This results in much more readable code.

>
> [!WARNING]
>
> The placement is very strict. You cannot use `if`, `for` or other structures to add inner instructions
> conditionally.
>

```kotlin
import hu.simplexion.adaptive.foundation.Adaptive

@Adaptive
fun someFun() {
    grid {
        rowTemplate(260.dp, 1.fr, 100.dp, 100.dp)
        colTemplate(1.fr)
        
        text("Hello World!", white)
    }
}
```

## Outer instructions

You can put instructions after rendering statements with the `..` (rangeTo) operator.
This also results in much readable code.

```kotlin
import hu.simplexion.adaptive.foundation.Adaptive
import hu.simplexion.adaptive.foundation.rangeTo

@Adaptive
fun someFun() {
    text("Hello World!") .. white .. titleMedium .. bold
}
```

You might want to use outer instructions on your own fragments. To do so, you have to:

- add the instructions parameter to the fragment
- add a return type
- add a return statement

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Adding instructions to your fragments **DOES NOT** apply the UI effect on the fragment
> itself. You have to pass them to an actual UI fragment to have coloring, background, etc.
>

```kotlin
@Adaptive
fun navButton(label: String, vararg instructions: AdaptiveInstruction): AdaptiveFragment {
    row(*button, *instructions) {
        text(label, color(0xffffffu), fontSize(15.sp), noSelect)
    }
    return fragment()
}
```

## Instructions used more than once

You can store instructions if you use them at different places:

```kotlin
val greenGradient = backgroundGradient(90, lightGreen, mediumGreen)
val cornerRadius8 = cornerRadius(8)
```

## Instruction sets

You can organize your instructions into arrays to make instruction sets:

```kotlin
val someStyles = arrayOf<AdaptiveInstriction>(greenGradient, cornerRadius8, AlignItems.Center, JustifyContent.Center)

@Adaptive
fun someFun() {

    row(2.gridCol, *someStyles) {
        text("Hello World!", white)
    }

}
```

You can also mix array instructions with single ones:

```kotlin
val centered = arrayOf<AdaptiveInstriction>(AlignItems.Center, JustifyContent.Center)

@Adaptive
fun someFun() {

    row(2.gridCol, *centered, greenGradient, cornerRadius8) {
        text("Hello World!", white)
    }

}
```

## Non-UI instructions

Instructions are not limited to styling nor to UI fragments. This is a server side
instruction:

```kotlin

class DelayStart(val duration: Duration) : AdaptiveInstuction

class SomeWorker : WorkerImpl<SomeWorker> {
    override suspend fun run() {
        ifHas<DelayStart> { delay(it.duration) }
    }
}

fun main() {

    server {
        worker(DelayStart(5.minutes)) { SomeWorker() }
    }

}
```

## Executable instructions

If you implement `AdaptiveInstruction.execute` in your instruction you can call it very easily.

Check the `onClick` in the following example. It calls the `execute` method of `Replace` if
there is a `Replace` instruction.

This invoke is no-op when there is no such instruction.

```kotlin
import hu.simplexion.adaptive.foundation.instruction.AdaptiveInstruction
import hu.simplexion.adaptive.foundation.instruction.invoke

@Adaptive
fun link(label: String, vararg instructions: AdaptiveInstruction) {
    text(label, onClick { instructions<Replace>() })
}
```

## Defining your own

> [!NOTE]
>
> It is good practice to make all instruction classes immutable. This is not enforced now
> but it might be in the future.
>

Simply create a class or an object that implements `AdaptiveInstruction`:

```kotlin
import hu.simplexion.adaptive.foundation.instruction.AdaptiveInstruction

class SomeInstruction(val someString: String)

object SomeOtherInstruction : AdaptiveInstruction
```

## Finding fragments with a given instruction

Use on of:

- `firstWith`
- `firstOrNullWith`
- `singleWith`
- `filterWith`

```kotlin
import hu.simplexion.adaptive.foundation.instruction.AdaptiveInstruction

object A : AdaptiveInstruction
object B : AdaptiveInstruction

@Adaptive
fun someFun() {
    row {
        onClick { 
            println(adapter().firstWith<A>())
            println(adapter().firstOrNullWith<A>())
            println(adapter().singleWith<A>())
            println(adapter().filterWith<A>())
        }
        
        text("a", A)
        text("a", B)
    }
}
```

## Use in manually implemented fragments

To let a fragment accept instructions add a `vararg` parameter called `instructions` with
the type `AdaptiveInstruction`.

To access instructions of another fragment from your manual implementation
use `AdaptiveFragment.instruction`.

The value of this property is the current instruction set from the state 
of the component, type is `Array<out AdaptiveInstruction>`.

If a given fragment does not have instructions (no parameter with the name
and type) you get an empty array.

The index of the instruction state variable is stored in the `instructionIndex`
property of the fragment.
