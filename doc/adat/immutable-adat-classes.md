# Immutable Adat Classes

An [adat class](README.md) is immutable when all of its properties are immutable.

Immutable classes are handy to keep the application logic consistent. You don't have to
worry about values changing without the whole instance changing.

`AdatClassMetadata.isImmutable` is `true` when the class is immutable, `false` otherwise.

However, this comes with a problem when you want to provide a user interface to edit
these classes. The `copyStore` producer solves this problem.

## Copy Store

Adaptive provides a producer called `copyStore` that produces a new copy whenever a fragment
changes a property in the class.

The built-in fragments recognize that `someAdat` belongs to a copy store and instead changing the value in-place
they send a change request to the store. The store then produces a new value which triggers a patch
in the fragment.

(Actually, all fragments that use `AdaptiveStateValueBinding` work automatically with `copyStore`).

```kotlin
@Adat
class SomeAdat(
    val s1 : String,
    val s2 : String
)

@Adaptive
fun someEditor() {
    val someAdat = copyStore { SomeAdat("", "") }
    
    input { someAdat.s1 }
    input { someAdat.s2 }
}
```

### Nested instances

The copy store supports nested instances, so you can build complex data structures.

> As of now, copy store **DOES NOT** support nested instances stored in lists, maps and sets.
> I'll add that in the near future as well.

```kotlin
import hu.simplexion.adaptive.adat.Adat
import hu.simplexion.adaptive.foundation.Adaptive

@Adat
class SomeAdat(
    val s1: String,
    val soa: SomeOtherAdat
)

@Adat
class SomeOtherAdat(
    val i1: Int,
    val yaa: YetAnotherAdat
)

@Adat
class YetAnotherAdat(
    val s2: String
)

@Adaptive
fun someEditor() {
    val someAdat = copyStore { SomeAdat("", SomeOtherAdat(12, YetAnotherAdat(true))) }

    yetAnotherEditor(someAdat.soa.yaa)
}

@Adaptive
fun yetAnotherEditor(yaa : YetAnotherAdat) {
    input { yaa.s2 }
}
```
