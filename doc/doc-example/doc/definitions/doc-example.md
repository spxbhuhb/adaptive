# doc-example

`doc-example` is a documentation [subproject](def://) of [Adaptive](def://) for example code that cannot 
be placed in other subprojects.

A typical case is an example of adding an [application module](def://) to the [application](def://)
as the application framework is usually not available for subprojects in the dependencies.
