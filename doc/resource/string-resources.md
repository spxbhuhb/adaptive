# String Resources

String resources are compiled into `.arv` (Adaptive Resource Values) files.

## Data size

These are from ChatGPT, so take them with a grain of salt.

The number of strings present in a mobile application can vary widely depending on the complexity,
purpose, and functionality of the app. However, here are some general estimates for different types
of mobile applications:

* Simple Apps (e.g., calculator, flashlight, basic utility apps):
    * Number of Strings: 50-200
* Moderate Complexity Apps (e.g., social media, news, fitness tracking):
    * Number of Strings: 200-1000
* Complex Apps (e.g., e-commerce, banking, extensive productivity tools):
    * Number of Strings: 1000-5000
* Highly Complex Apps (e.g., large-scale enterprise apps, comprehensive games, multi-functional platforms):
    * Number of Strings: 5000+

With 5000 strings and average size of 50 characters/string and 25 characters of metadata, the total size is 375 KB.
If we double the bytes needed per character (Unicode), that is 625 KB.

### Generated code size

These calculations are based on the code I copied from Compose in May 2024. Most probably it will get optimized,
but it is good to have some pointers to base our future development on.

Using the following string resource:

```xml
<resources>
    <string name="app_name">"Good Morning"</string>
    <string name="snooze">Snooze</string>
    <string name="sleepiness">Sleepiness:</string>
    <string name="by_joining">By joining you agree to our</string>
    <string name="terms_of_service">Terms of Service</string>
    <string name="and">and</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy">Privacy Policy</string>
</resources>
```

I get these file sizes (~11 KB):

```text
-rw-r--r--  1 tiz  staff  3935 Jul 10 03:51 CommonMainString0.class
-rw-r--r--  1 tiz  staff   721 Jul 10 03:51 Res$string.class
-rw-r--r--  1 tiz  staff  2192 Jul 10 03:51 Res.class
-rw-r--r--  1 tiz  staff  4425 Jul 10 03:51 String0_commonMainKt.class

```

Most of it is probably just overhead. Duplicating the strings:

```xml
<resources>
    <string name="app_name">"Good Morning"</string>
    <string name="snooze">Snooze</string>
    <string name="sleepiness">Sleepiness:</string>
    <string name="by_joining">By joining you agree to our</string>
    <string name="terms_of_service">Terms of Service</string>
    <string name="and">and</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy">Privacy Policy</string>

    <string name="app_name2">"Good Morning"</string>
    <string name="snooze2">Snooze</string>
    <string name="sleepiness2">Sleepiness:</string>
    <string name="by_joining2">By joining you agree to our</string>
    <string name="terms_of_service2">Terms of Service</string>
    <string name="and2">and</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy2">Privacy Policy</string>
</resources>
```

Results in (~17 KB):

```text
-rw-r--r--  1 tiz  staff  6479 Jul 10 03:49 CommonMainString0.class
-rw-r--r--  1 tiz  staff   721 Jul 10 03:49 Res$string.class
-rw-r--r--  1 tiz  staff  2192 Jul 10 03:49 Res.class
-rw-r--r--  1 tiz  staff  7471 Jul 10 03:49 String0_commonMainKt.class
```

So, by adding 81 chars of keys and 89 chars of data **~ 170 bytes**, the size of the generated code
grown by **~ 5.6 KB**, that is **times 32**.

Projecting this increment to size calculations for 5000 strings, the generated code would be **375 KB * 32 = 12 MB**.

I really think that in case of built-in application strings, the size of the actual data is absolutely negligible, the
size of the generated code is a real problem on the other hand. Especially that this is for one language, no qualifiers.
