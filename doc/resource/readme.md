## Setup

Resource support is part of the core module and the standard Adaptive Gradle plugin.

To add resources create an `adaptiveResources` directory the source set you want 
to add the resources to:

<img alt="Directories" height="240" src="directories.png" width="248"/>

Change the settings of the resource handling in the `adaptive` extension in `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
adaptive {
    resources {
        publicResClass = true
        packageOfResClass = "some.library.resources"
        generateResClass = always
    }
}
```

`publicResClass`
  - `true` = generated `Res` class is public
  - `false` = generated `Res` class is internal
  - default: `false`

`packageOfResClass`
  - package to generate the `Res` class into
  - default: `<group name>.<module name>.generated.resources`

`generateResClass`
   - `always` - generate the `Res` class
   - `auto` - generate the `Res` class
   - `never` - do not generate the `Res` class
   - default: `auto`

## Qualifiers

All resource types (except for raw files in the files directory) support qualifiers.
Apply qualifiers to directory names using a hyphen, for example:

`drawable-hu-rHU-hdpi-light`
- `hu` language
- `rHU` country
- `hdpi` density
- `light` theme

You can add these qualifiers:

- language
- theme
- density

If a resource with the requested qualifier doesn't exist, the default resource without a qualifier is used instead.

### Language and regional qualifiers

The language is defined by:

- a two-letter (ISO 639-1) 
- or a three-letter (ISO 639-2) language code

To specify the country, add a ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 country code with an `r` prefix, like `hu-rHU`.

The language and country codes are case-sensitive.

### Theme qualifier

- `light`
- `dark`

### Densities

- `ldpi` − 120 DPI, 0.75x density
- `mdpi` − 160 DPI, 1x density
- `hdpi` − 240 DPI, 1.5x density
- `xhdpi` − 320 DPI, 2x density
- `xxhdpi` − 480 DPI, 3x density
- `xxxhdpi` − 640dpi, 4x density

### Sources

Check these files to see how the given qualifier is retrieved on the given platform:

| Platform | Class                                                                                                           |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| android  | [withAndroidResources.kt](/adaptive-ui/src/androidMain/kotlin/fun/adaptive/ui/platform/withAndroidResources.kt) |
| ios      | [withIosResources.kt](/adaptive-ui/src/iosMain/kotlin/fun/adaptive/ui/platform/withIosResources.kt)             |
| browser  | [withJsResources.kt](/adaptive-ui/src/jsMain/kotlin/fun/adaptive/ui/platform/withJsResources.kt)                |

## Res class

The `Res` class is generated by these:

- project import into IDEA
- `./gradlew build`
- `./gradlew generateAdaptiveResClass`

You can find the class in the `build\generated` directory:

<img alt="Res class" height="432" src="res-class.png" width="552"/>

## Using resources

You can simply use the resource items directly in adaptive functions which support them:

```kotlin
@Adaptive 
fun bg() {
    image(R.drawable.background)
}
```

## iOS

As of now, we have to copy the resources directory into the iOS app manually. This could be automatized with 
a Gradle task quite easily. 

The source is `build/kotlin-multiplatform-resources/aggregated-resources/iosArm64`.

This is how it should look like:

<img alt="iOS resources" height="192" src="ios-resources.png" width="500"/>

To include a folder in the iOS application bundle as-is, follow these steps:

* Xcode, open the project
* Right-click on the project in the Project Navigator and select "Add Files to ..."
* In the file dialog, navigate to and select the folder you want to add.
* In the options dialog, ensure the "Create folder references" option is selected instead of "Create groups". This keeps the folder structure intact.
* Click "Add".
