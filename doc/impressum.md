# Motivation

I can summarize my motivation for writing Adaptive in three words (ok, it's four, I know):

- pretty code
- flow
- freedom

I've been struggling for years because I've always felt that the existing tools are very capable, but they
are not for me. Ugly code, a lot of boilerplate, breaking my flow of thoughts with syntax, just to mention
a few of the problems.

I always wanted to **simply** express what I want and voilÃ , it works!

I love the strictness of Kotlin, I love the strong typing, the well-thought-out language rules. Kotlin itself
is very close to what I like.

On the other hand I've always felt that the ecosystem lacks the fluency, lacks a particular kind of beauty
code can reach when it's clean and expressive.

Not to mention that many official libraries are very, very closed. This is for a reason of course. To help
the developers and the programmers write easy to upgrade, error free code.

This closeness strong-handles me into ways which I really-really don't like.

So, at the end it is personal preference. I like my freedom, my flow and my pretty-pretty code so much that
I've spent countless hours on writing Adaptive. And honestly, the more I spend the more I enjoy working with it.

In addition to the things above, I feel that Adaptive has started to become a very interesting project.

It offers a quite unique toolset. The fragments and the instructions give so much freedom to work with,
many ideas are trivial to implement.

There is a cost for this freedom. Adaptive is in its infancy, covers mostly what I need for my own internal
projects. It lacks many of the usual strictness at the high level, the compiler plugin is a kind of
"I've seen it work, sometimes, I think, maybe?" thing. It is nowhere close to a complete toolset,
I don't even start to compare it to Compose.

To be honest, I don't expect much enthusiasm about this project. It is a bit too far from the mainstream, there
are good viable - and well marketed - alternatives. Also, it is pretty hard to make it production ready for the
public, I don't really know if I'll ever mark it so.

We'll see how it turns out. I've put in the work, and I'll continue to do so in the foreseeable future.
