## Breaking changes

### `@ServiceProvider`

Service implementations now have to be annotated with `@ServiceProvider`. This made compiler plugin
processing easier.

#### Upgrade

Add `@ServiceProvider` to all classes that extend `ServiceImpl`.

**NOTE**: I'll probably remove the need for extending `ServiceImpl` and add it from the compiler plugin automatically.

## Additions

- canvas examples, including basics and the first widget experiment
- the compiler plugin now adds `kotlin.time.ExperimentalTime"` opt-in to projects automatically

## Fixes

- fix `ActualBrowserCanvas` path `arcTo` end angle calculation error

## Removals

- unused `adatCompanionOf` function
- unused `AdatCompanionResolve` annotation

## Internal

- added `core-build` subproject that contains shared build logic
  - moved publishing logic into `core-build`
  - moved skip yarn lock into `core-build`
