# Supposedly unique

Supposedly unique means that something should be unique, but there is no actual guarantee
for the uniqueness.

For example, it cannot be guaranteed that two independent software libraries do not use the
same package and/or class names. These should be unique to avoid conflict, but it is simply
not possible to guarantee it in all cases.
