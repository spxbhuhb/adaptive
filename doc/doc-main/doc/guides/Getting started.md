# Getting started

The easiest way to get started with Adaptive is to clone an example
project from GitHub and start playing around with it:

- [adaptive-mpw-example](https://github.com/spxbhuhb/adaptive-mpw-example)

## Compatibility matrix

Adaptive is currently a "bleeding-edge" project. This means the focus is on new features
and refactoring (when needed) rather than stability.

While this may change in the future, we do not currently guarantee API stability.

**NOTE**: Snapshot releases are available for 90 days as per Maven Central policy.

**NOTE**: Versions of dependencies in snapshot releases may change without notice.

| Adaptive                         | Kotlin         | Coroutines | Datetime | Ktor     |
|----------------------------------|----------------|------------|----------|----------|
| `0.25.724+2.2.0-SNAPSHOT`        | `2.2.0`        | `1.10.2`   | `0.7.1`  | `3.2.2`  |
| `0.25.719+2.2.20-Beta1-SNAPSHOT` | `2.2.20-Beta1` | `1.10.2`   | `0.4.0`  | `3.2.2`  |
| `0.25.718`                       | `2.1.20`       | `1.8.1`    | `0.4.0`  | `2.3.11` |

## Using snapshot

Add the snapshot repository to `settings.gradle.kts` (both to `pluginManagement` and `dependencyResolutionManagement`):

```kotlin
rootProject.name = "app-driver"

pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        gradlePluginPortal()
        mavenCentral()
        google()
        maven("https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots/")
    }
}

dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven("https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots/")
    }
    versionCatalogs {
        create("libs") {
            from(files("../../gradle/libs.versions.toml"))
        }
    }
}
```
