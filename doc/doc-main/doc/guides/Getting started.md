# Getting started

The easiest way to get started with Adaptive is to clone an example
project from GitHub and start playing around with it:

- [adaptive-mpw-example](https://github.com/spxbhuhb/adaptive-mpw-example)

## Compatibility matrix

Adaptive is currently a "bleeding-edge" project. This means the focus is on new features
and refactoring (when needed) rather than stability.

While this may change in the future, we do not currently guarantee API stability.

**NOTE**: Snapshot releases are available for 90 days as per Maven Central policy.

**NOTE**: Versions of dependencies in snapshot releases may change without notice.
