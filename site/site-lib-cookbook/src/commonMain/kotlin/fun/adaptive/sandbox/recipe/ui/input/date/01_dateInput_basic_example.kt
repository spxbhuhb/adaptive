 * - Pressing `Esc` closes the popup.
 * - `Cancel` resets the date to the value before the popup has been opened.
 * - `Ok` just closes the popup.
 *
 * The text is not editable, that's a can of worms I really don't want to open now.
 *
 * > Closing with `Esc` saves the value, I'm not sure if I like that. To change this
