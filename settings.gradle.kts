    // This block is crucial for making the plugins from core-build available.
    // By default, composite builds do not expose their plugins to the main build unless specified.
    // The `dependencySubstitution` ensures that any request for the plugin ID
    // provided by `core-build` is satisfied by this included build.
    // This is especially important if you were to define a `plugins { id("...") version "..." }`
    // block in your main settings.gradle.kts or root build.gradle.kts for your own plugins.
    //
    // For simple cases, `pluginManagement` + `includeBuild` is often enough without explicit
    // `dependencySubstitution` for direct plugin application in subprojects.
    // However, it's good practice for clarity or if you're substituting other plugins.
    //
    // For direct plugin application, the `includeBuild` call itself is
    // sufficient to make the plugins visible. No explicit substitution is required here unless
    // you are trying to *override* a plugin from a repository.
