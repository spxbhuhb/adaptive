/**
 * Each fragment may have one (and only one) [NavNode] in [AbstractNavSupport.nodes].
 * The first time the fragment uses a nav producer, a new node is created for that
 * fragment.
 *
 * Producers cannot be used indirectly (`val a = if (something) navSegment() else "b"` is
 * not allowed), so it is guaranteed that the consumed segment count is the same for all states.
 *
 * @param  owner     The fragment this nav node belongs to.
 * @param  navData   Calculated from the [navData] of the first parent fragment that has
 *                   a [NavNode] in [AbstractNavSupport.nodes].
 * @param  consumed  The number of navigation segments this nav node consumed. A segment
 *                   is consumed each time a nav producer is used.
