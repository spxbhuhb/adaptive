# Fragment hydration

Fragment hydration refers to the process of turning [fragment models](def://) into actual, working fragments.

This technique makes it possible to load [fragments](def://) especially [UI fragments](def://) as data
on-demand, only when the [user interface](def://) requires it. This can speed up [client application](def://)
startup and can provide server-side rendering as well.

[grove-runtime](def://) provides the functions to perform fragment hydration.
