# Fragment model

Fragment models are sets of data that describe a [fragment](def://), most cases a [UI fragment](def://).

In case of [UI fragments](def://), the models describe the content of the fragment, where is it placed,
what style, coloring, arrangement it uses, etc.

Using fragment models lets an application avoid hard-coded [user interfaces](def://) and also opens
other possibilities such as transforming models without the complex task of program code interpretation and
compilation.

Fragment models can be loaded on-demand and then hydrated with [fragment hydration](def://).
